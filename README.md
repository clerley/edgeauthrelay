# Edge Auth System.


Define an edge authorization and authentication system.  I started this project while working on my master's in Cybersecurity at Syracuse University.<br/> 
The Company that I worked for at the time was specialized in Point of Sale for Convenience stores. A common problem was how to remove <br/> 
the dependency on the Network/Internet but still take advantage of modern Cloud technology. Most Convenience stores operate 24 hours a day; <br/>
any downtime at the POS can cause significant monetary loss, so I wanted to perform an OAuth like authorization but in a distributed manner at the site.<br/> 
<br/>
<br/>
The backend is coded in GoLang. As far as unit test goes, I think I have pretty good code coverage, probably over 90%. <br/>
The frontend I was a lot less careful. I have used this project as a tool to learn Flutter. I like that I can design the UI programmatically,<br/>
and I can get good results quickly. I think Google has done an outstanding job creating the Flutter framework. <br/>
I got the same code base to run on Chrome, MacOS, Android, and even Linux and Windows (Even though those latter platforms are in the early stages of support). <br/>
